P1 Modify add_quote.php so that it confirms that the quotes.txt file exists,
   prior to checking if itâ€™s writable.

   Make the text area in add_quote.php sticky.

   Change add_quote.php so that it takes the quotation and the attribution
   as separate inputs and writes them separately to the text file. Then
   modify view_quote.php so that it retrieves and displays both pieces of
   data.

   Modify view_quote.php so that it displays two random quotations.

   Update upload_file.php, making it confirm that the uploads directory is
   writable.

   View the PHP manual page for the glob() function to see what it can do
   and how to use it.

   Update list_dir.php to display other information about the files in a
   directory.
A See add_quote.php, list_dir.php & view_quote.php

P2 Create a system to guarantee unique usernames in register.php. Hint:
   Before you attempt to create the directory, use PHP to check your list
   of existing usernames for a match to the just-registered name. If no
   match is found, the new name is acceptable.

   If the username is already in use, then PHP can create an error message
   requesting a new username.
A  See register.php

P3 Use the combination of writing to and reading from text files, plus
   either sessions or cookies, to create a real registration and login
   system.
A  See start.html, login-sys.php, register-sys.php & showtime-sys.php
